Asking the right question.
Curiousity 

A process of *inspecting*, *cleansing*, *transforming* and *modeling* data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusion and supporting decision-making.

Programming language : Python R Julia

*Why Python* - powerful libraries, free and open source, amazing community
*Why R* -  when R Studio is needed, dealing with advanced statistical methods and when extreme performance is needed

*Processes of Data Analysis*
1. Data Extraction
2. Data Cleaning 
3. Data Wrangling
4. Analysis
5. Action

Python libraries for Data Analysis
* pandas
* matplotlib
* numpy
* seaborn
* statsmodels
* scipy
* scikit-learn

#### NumPy (Numeric Python)
---
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. 
NumPy uses primitive types(floats, ints) which makes storing and computation efficient, while in Python everything is an object.
> Do the practical (jupyter notebook)

#### Pandas
---
Pandas data structure
* Series
* DataFrame
> Do the practical (jupyter notebook)

loc and iloc to select row

#### Data Cleaning
---
missing data
invalid data
need domain knowledge
> Do the practical
